                            By using the QR Safe website, you agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
                            If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our service.

                        <p>
                            QR Safe allows users to generate secure QR codes from provided URLs.
                            You are solely responsible for the content of the URLs you submit. QR Safe does not verify or endorse the content behind these URLs.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Reporting Unsafe QR Codes</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you encounter a QR code that leads to malicious or harmful content, you can report it using the <strong>&quot;Report an unsafe QR code&quot;</strong> feature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When accessing the <strong>/report</strong> page, you&apos;ll see a form where you can enter the URL associated with the suspicious QR code.
                            Upon submission, if the URL matches an existing QR code in our system, a flag will be added to that URL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a URL receives <strong>3 or more flags</strong>, it will become permanently inaccessible through QR Safe, preventing further access or generation.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">URL Validation</h2>
                        <p>
                            QR Safe employs robust validation techniques to ensure the safety and legitimacy of submitted URLs:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Google Safe Browsing:</strong> Each submitted URL is checked against Google&apos;s Safe Browsing database to detect malware, phishing, unwanted software, and other threats.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Simple URL Validations:</strong> Basic checks ensure the URL uses HTTPS protocol, has a properly formatted domain, and doesn&apos;t match common patterns of malicious or deceptive sites.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Despite these precautions, we cannot guarantee absolute security or accuracy. Always exercise caution when scanning unknown QR codes.
